# PythonProjectOne

Visualization and implementation of various traversal algorithms for the purpose of:
-Relearning forgotten algorithms, without looking at older implementations or any implementations online
-Familiarising myself with Python

Commits on master are all squashed rebases of the other branches, so that the history remains clean.
To see all of the commits, go to the individual branches (at the moment the chronological order of what has been implemented is: 1. visualize-branch -> 2. bfs-and-dijkstra-algorithms)

To run this project you just need a working Python environment.
